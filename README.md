# MLBasics

## Description
This project was a simple one that I completed at the start of the pandemic.<br>
The goal was to help me understand some of the basics of machine learning and some machine learning algorithms, and implement some of these aloritms of sample datasets.<br>
As well as learning what tensor flow is and how to work with it.<br>
Everything that I learned theory wise throughout this process is documented 
[here] (https://www.notion.so/Python-Machine-Learning-Tutorial-8bddc36586364af5acb438e33361e3af)
on this notion page.

## Conclusion
In the end I was able to build some models using built-in algoritms and generate some fairly accurate models.<br> 
I was even able to generate some visual models such as the one shown below.<br> 
Moving forward I would like to keep exploring topics in machine learning and develop some models that can work as part of an working app.<br>
